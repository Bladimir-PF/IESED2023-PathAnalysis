It may be unhelpful however to simply abandon the hierarchy without having a framework or guide to replace it. One such framework is discussed. This is based around a matrix, and emphasises the need to match research questions to specific types of research. This emphasis on methodological appropriateness, and on typologies rather than hierarchies of evidence may be helpful in organising and appraising public health evidence.},

Further, there was considerable diversity across the meta-analyses in terms of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, types of psychosocial treatments reviewed, methodological characteristics, and magnitude of reported effect sizes, making it difficult to aggregate findings across meta-analyses or to investigate moderators of outcome. Effect sizes varied across the outcomes assessed, with meta-analyses reporting positive and significant effect sizes for measures of some areas of child impairment (e.g., social impairment) and small and more variable effect sizes for distal and/or untargeted outcomes (e.g., academic achievement). Results are reviewed in light of the larger literature on psychosocial interventions for ADHD, and specific recommendations for future meta-analyses of psychosocial treatments for ADHD are offered.",

Although we believe the methods we outline are important for any study, they are particularly useful for researchers who wish to avoid the null hypothesis significance testing paradigm. We articulate three basic principles of data presentation: (a) use graphic displays to facilitate understanding of descriptive statistics, (b) provide measures of variability with measures of central tendency for continuous outcomes, and (c) compute and thoughtfully interpret effect sizes and effect size translations. We then put these principles into action using data drawn from two real social psychological experiments and provide tools (including software code and a new effect size translation) that will help researchers to quickly and efficiently adopt the recommendations that they find sensible. }

For binary outcomes, communication is relatively straightforward and supported by several statistical tools (e.g., the risk ratio and the number needed to treat [NNT]). For continuous outcomes, the situation is much worse. We discuss several alternatives and propose a new metric, NNTthreshold, that is analogous to the \{NNT\} statistic for binary outcomes and that is useful when a clinically meaningful threshold can be identified. Method We use both statistical theory and a statistical simulation to demonstrate how to compute \{NNTthreshold\} and to investigate how it behaves. Results \{NNTthreshold\} appears to function well, though is slightly conservative in our simulation. Conclusion Study authors need to think carefully about how to discuss study results when outcomes are continuously scaled. NNTthreshold should be helpful in situations in which a clinically meaningful threshold can be identified. "

abstract="The problem of gambling addiction can be especially noteworthy among college and university students, many of whom have the resources, proximity, free time, and desire to become involved in the myriad options of gambling now available. Although limited attention has been paid specifically to college student gambling in the body of literature, there have been two published meta-analyses estimating the prevalence of probable pathological gambling among college students. This present study aims to be the third, presenting an up-to-date proportion of those students exhibiting gambling pathology, and is the first to include international studies from outside the United States and Canada. The purpose of this study was to use the most up-to-date meta-analytical procedures to synthesize the rates of probable pathological gambling for college and university students worldwide. A thorough literature review and coding procedure resulted in 19 independent data estimates retrieved from 18 studies conducted between 2005 and 2013. To synthesize the studies, a random effects model for meta-analysis was applied. The estimated proportion of probable pathological gamblers among the over 13,000 college students surveyed was computed at 10.23 {\%}, considerably higher than either of the two previously published meta-analyses, and more than double the rate reported in the first meta-analysis of this type published in 1999. Implications and recommendations for future practice in dealing with college students and gambling addiction are outlined and described for both administrators and mental health professionals.",

abstract="Like many in the human services professions, teachers are susceptible to the feelings of burnout due to their job demands, as well as interactions with students, colleagues, administrators, and parents. Many studies have identified teacher burnout as one of the crucial components influencing teacher attrition. It has been suggested that self-efficacy is a protective factor against burnout. By way of multivariate meta-analysis, we examined the evidence for classroom management self-efficacy (CMSE) in relation to the three dimensions of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and (lowered) personal accomplishment. Results from sixteen studies indicate that there is a significant relationship between classroom management self-efficacy and the three dimensions of burnout, suggesting that teachers with higher levels of CMSE are less likely to experience the feelings of burnout. Practical implications, as well recommendations for future research, are discussed.",

abstract = {Meta-analyses of a treatment's effect compared with a control frequently calculate the meta-effect from standardized mean differences (SMDs). SMDs are usually estimated by Cohen's d or Hedges' g. Cohen's d divides the difference between sample means of a continuous response by the pooled standard deviation, but is subject to nonnegligible bias for small sample sizes. Hedges' g removes this bias with a correction factor. The current literature (including meta-analysis books and software packages) is confusingly inconsistent about methods for synthesizing SMDs, potentially making reproducibility a problem. Using conventional methods, the variance estimate of SMD is associated with the point estimate of SMD, so Hedges' g is not guaranteed to be unbiased in meta-analyses. This article comprehensively reviews and evaluates available methods for synthesizing SMDs. Their performance is compared using extensive simulation studies and analyses of actual datasets. We find that because of the intrinsic association between point estimates and standard errors, the usual version of Hedges' g can result in more biased meta-estimation than Cohen's d. We recommend using average-adjusted variance estimators to obtain an unbiased meta-estimate, and the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method for accurate estimation of its confidence interval.},

There is a need to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of psychosocial treatments for ADHD given discrepancies between meta-analyses. The present meta-analysis reports the results of between-group studies that compared a psychosocial treatment to a control condition from 1968 to 2016. In total, 226 studies were identified that met inclusion criteria. Results of the meta-analysis were organized by treatment type, rater, and domain of outcome assessed. Results indicated considerable variability across these parameters, with the strongest effects for proximal outcomes of behavioral parent training (improvements in parenting behaviors yielded a standardized mean difference of 0.70) and improvements in child behavior following implementation of behavioral school intervention (standardized mean difference of 0.66 and 0.72 for teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms and impairment, respectively). Other interventions were not extensively studied as stand-alone approaches. Results are discussed in light of current support for the use of psychosocial interventions for individuals with ADHD. }

abstract = {When we speak about heterogeneity in a meta-analysis, our intent is usually to understand the substantive implications of the heterogeneity. If an intervention yields a mean effect size of 50 points, we want to know if the effect size in different populations varies from 40 to 60, or from 10 to 90, because this speaks to the potential utility of the intervention. While there is a common belief that the I2 statistic provides this information, it actually does not. In this example, if we are told that I2 is 50\%, we have no way of knowing if the effects range from 40 to 60, or from 10 to 90, or across some other range. Rather, if we want to communicate the predicted range of effects, then we should simply report this range. This gives readers the information they think is being captured by I2 and does so in a way that is concise and unambiguous. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract There are two popular statistical models for meta-analysis, the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model. The fact that these two models employ similar sets of formulas to compute statistics, and sometimes yield similar estimates for the various parameters, may lead people to believe that the models are interchangeable. In fact, though, the models represent fundamentally different assumptions about the data. The selection of the appropriate model is important to ensure that the various statistics are estimated correctly. Additionally, and more fundamentally, the model serves to place the analysis in context. It provides a framework for the goals of the analysis as well as for the interpretation of the statistics. In this paper we explain the key assumptions of each model, and then outline the differences between the models. We conclude with a discussion of factors to consider when choosing between the two models. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the χ2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of H that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Each review pools the results from the relevant trials in order to evaluate the efficacy of a certain treatment for a specified medical condition. These reviews lack consistent assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect before pooling. We discuss a random effects approach to combining evidence from a series of experiments comparing two treatments. This approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. The model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. We suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies.}

In this context, the usual goal is to estimate the central tendency and the amount of heterogeneity in the population effect sizes. The amount of heterogeneity in a set of effect sizes has implications regarding the interpretation of the meta-analytic findings and often serves as an indicator for the presence of potential moderator variables. Five population heterogeneity estimators were compared in this article analytically and via Monte Carlo simulations with respect to their bias and efficiency. }

However, interesting moderator variables are generally related to each other as well as to effect sizes. This confounding among moderator variables can make the results of any analysis focusing on a single moderator variable misleading. Despite the ambiguity of such results, this form of analysis is common in meta-analytic studies of intervention. The hazards and complexities of investigating and interpreting confounded moderator variables are illustrated in this article by the author's examining the difference in effect sizes associated with randomized versus nonrandomized designs in a large meta-analytic database of delinquency intervention studies. }

 abstract = {Analyses of results of studies documented in 23 reports on coaching for the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) indicated that, on average, coaching can help increase SAT scores. However, considerable variability in results for 48 studies reflected the fact that not all coaching is necessarily effective and that all studies of coaching do not provide similar views of coaching's effectiveness. Results of published and unpublished studies were analyzed separately. Characteristics related to the magnitudes of coaching effects included date of publication of the study, whether the study was sponsored by the Educational Testing Service and used as a comparison group, whether instruction included test practice and attention to test-taking skills, and whether homework was assigned to students. Coaching effects were stronger for the SAT Mathematical subtest. Published comparison studies gave consistent results with coached groups exceeding controls by 0.09 standard deviations on SAT-V and 0.16 on SAT-M. Studies of coaching were found to be rather poorly reported and designed without much attention to the issues discussed in reviews of the coaching literature.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. {DESIGN:} Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURE:} Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. {RESULTS:} In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. {CONCLUSIONS:} A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

    abstract = { Background The published clinical research literature may be distorted by the pursuit of statistically significant results.Purpose We aimed to develop a test to explore biases stemming from the pursuit of nominal statistical significance.Methods The exploratory test evaluates whether there is a relative excess of formally significant findings in the published literature due to any reason (e.g., publication bias, selective analyses and outcome reporting, or fabricated data). The number of expected studies with statistically significant results is estimated and compared against the number of observed significant studies. The main application uses α = 0.05, but a range of α thresholds is also examined. Different values or prior distributions of the effect size are assumed. Given the typically low power (few studies per research question), the test may be best applied across domains of many meta-analyses that share common characteristics (interventions, outcomes, study populations, research environment).Results We evaluated illustratively eight meta-analyses of clinical trials with >50 studies each and 10 meta-analyses of clinical efficacy for neuroleptic agents in schizophrenia; the 10 meta-analyses were also examined as a composite domain. Different results were obtained against commonly used tests of publication bias. We demonstrated a clear or possible excess of significant studies in 6 of 8 large meta-analyses and in the wide domain of neuroleptic treatments.Limitations The proposed test is exploratory, may depend on prior assumptions, and should be applied cautiously.Conclusions An excess of significant findings may be documented in some clinical research fields.

The derivations presented in this article provide the effect size and its variance. Standard errors and confidence intervals can be computed for individual r[sub]sp[/sub] values. Also, meta-analysis of the semipartial correlations can proceed in a similar fashion to typical meta-analyses, where weighted analyses can be used to explore heterogeneity and to estimate central tendency and variation in the effects.

Teachers' verbal ability has been thought to predict student achievement ever since the relationship was found in the classic Equality of Educational Opportunity (EEO) study by Coleman et al. By way of meta-analysis the authors examine the evidence on teachers' verbal ability as a predictor of school outcomes. They find that the evidence is not as extensive as might be inferred from prior reports. Results of 19 studies indicate that teachers' verbal ability is at best very weakly related to school outcomes, and the main evidence for this weak relationship arises from the EEO study. Other studies find that verbal ability is unrelated to school outcomes. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.},

This effect of suppression is used to provide a revised definition of suppression and completely accounts for traditional and negative suppression. The revised definition, in conjunction with a two factor model, is shown to lead to a previously undetected type of suppression (reciprocal suppression) which occurs when predictors with positive zero order validities are negatively correlated with one another. In terms of the definition and parameters of the model, limits are determined in which the types of suppression can occur. Furthermore, it is shown how suppressors can be identified in multiple regression equations and a procedure is given for interpreting whether the variables are contributing directly (by predicting relevant variance in the criterion) or indirectly (by removing irrel},

The inference procedure used in these reviews, vote counting, is known to be problematic. This study is a reanalysis of data from these earlier reviews, using more sophisticated synthesis methods. It shows systematic positive relations between resource inputs and school outcomes. Moreover, analyses of the magnitude of these relations suggest that the median relation (regression coefficient) is large enough to be of practical importance.While this reanalysis suggests that previous data do not support the conclusions that Hanushek and others derived from it, limitations of their data set warrant caution in using it for policy formation.},

  Abstract                 = {{Background: Suicide represents a substantial problem, with significant societal and personal impact. The identification of factors influencing suicide risk is an important step in preventing self-harming behaviour. In this article the authors explore whether emotional instability increases risk of suicide, beyond that of mood intensity. Method: This article provides a summary of existing theory and indirect evidence in support of an association between emotional instability and suicidality. A systematic literature search (Embase, Medline, PsychInfo) was carried out on literature conducted up to October, 2011. Meta-analysis was used to assess the strength of the proposed association. Results: The systematic search identified 20 journal articles meeting the inclusion criteria, including retrospective questionnaire design studies and research conducted across several time-points. Meta-analysis revealed a moderate association, which remained statistically significant even when only including studies conducted over multiple time-points. This effect was attenuated, but remained significant, when controlling for study selection bias. Limitations: Retrospective questionnaire studies failed to adequately control for mood level. Little is still currently understood about the types of emotional instability (e.g., dysoria, anxiety) most associated with suicidality. Conclusions: Future avenues of investigation include micro- to macro-longitudinal research and the differentiation of emotion subtypes and instability metrics. Momentary assessment techniques may help to detect subtle fluctuations in mood leading to more effective and immediate intervention. Psychosocial intervention strategies for treating unstable emotions are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

  Abstract                 = {Suppressor situations occur when the simultaneous inclusion of two predictors improves one or both validities. A common allegation is that suppressor effects rarely replicate and have little substantive import. We present substantive examples from two established research domains to counter this skepticism. In the first domain, we show how measures of guilt and shame act consistently as mutual suppressors: Adding shame into a regression equation increases the negative association between guilt and aggression, whereas adding guilt increases the positive association between shame and aggression. In the second domain, we show how the effects of self-esteem and narcissism operate consistently as mutual suppressors: That is, adding narcissism into a regression equation increases the negative association between self-esteem and antisocial behavior, whereas adding self-esteem increases the positive association between narcissism and antisocial behavior.

  Abstract                 = {This research reports an investigation of the use of standardized regression (beta) coefficients in meta-analyses that use correlation coefficients as the effect-size metric. The investigation consisted of analyzing more than 1,700 corresponding beta coefficients and correlation coefficients harvested from published studies. Results indicate that, under certain conditions, using knowledge of corresponding beta coefficients to impute missing correlations (effect sizes) generally produces relatively accurate and precise population effect-size estimates. Potential benefits from applying this knowledge include smaller sampling errors because of increased numbers of effect sizes and smaller nonsampling errors because of the inclusion of a broader array of research designs.

Increased emphasis on evaluation and accountability has increased desire for sound evaluations of these interventions; and at the same time, school-level data have become increasingly available. This article shows researchers how to bridge these two trends through careful use of school-level data to estimate the effectiveness of particular interventions. The author provides an overview of common methods for estimating causal effects with school-level data, including randomized experiments, regression analysis, pre–post studies, and nonexperimental comparison group designs. She stresses the importance of careful design of nonexperimental studies, particularly the need to compare units that were similar before treatment assignment. She gives examples of analyses that use school-level data and concludes with advice for researchers.},

 abstract = {When experimental designs are infeasible, researchers must resort to the use of observational data from surveys, censuses, and administrative records. Because assignment to the independent variables of observational data is usually nonrandom, the challenge of estimating causal effects with observational data can be formidable. In this chapter, we review the large literature produced primarily by statisticians and econometricians in the past two decades on the estimation of causal effects from observational data. We first review the now widely accepted counterfactual framework for the modeling of causal effects. After examining estimators, both old and new, that can be used to estimate causal effects from cross-sectional data, we present estimators that exploit the additional information furnished by longitudinal data. Because of the size and technical nature of the literature, we cannot offer a fully detailed and comprehensive presentation. Instead, we present only the main features of methods that are accessible and potentially of use to quantitatively oriented sociologists.},

Second, we utilize Rubin’s causal model to interpret the bias necessary to invalidate an inference in terms of sample replacement. We apply our analysis to an inference of a positive effect of Open Court Curriculum on reading achievement from a randomized experiment, and an inference of a negative effect of kindergarten retention on reading achievement from an observational study. We consider details of our framework, and then discuss how our approach informs judgment of inference relative to study design. We conclude with implications for scientific discourse.},

abstract ={The effect of unreliability of measurement on propensity score (PS) adjusted treatment effects has not been previously studied. The authors report on a study simulating different degrees of unreliability in the multiple covariates that were used to estimate the PS. The simulation uses the same data as two prior studies. Shadish, Clark, and Steiner showed that a PS formed from many covariates demonstrably reduced selection bias, while Steiner, Cook, Shadish, and Clark identified the subsets of covariates from the larger set that were most effective for bias reduction. Adding different degrees of random error to these covariates in a simulation, the authors demonstrate that unreliability of measurement can degrade the ability of PSs to reduce bias. Specifically, increases in reliability only promote bias reduction, if the covariates are effective in reducing bias to begin with. Increasing or decreasing the reliability of covariates that do not effectively reduce selection bias makes no difference at all.},

abstract = "Subjects in clinical trials are frequently randomized within blocks to ensure balance between treatment groups during the accrual period. Often, the block sizes themselves are also randomly selected. If the trial is unblinded and the block size known, the treatment assignment of some subjects will be known before they are randomized. This knowledge could lead to a bias where the investigator selects healthier subjects for a particular treatment. An investigator's potential to bias study depends on two factors: knowledge of the block distribution and the extent to which he uses this knowledge. Both factors are investigated. Knowledge of the block distribution is reflected by the variability of the estimates of the distribution. Maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) and ad hoc estimates are considered. An investigator's willingness to bias is formalized by defining a class of schemes where the decision to bias depends on the probability of correctly guessing a treatment assignment. The amount of bias these different schemes can introduce is quantified. Fixed blocks are easier to estimate and more susceptible to bias than random blocks. In general, the block distribution with least bias depends on the investigator's biasing strategy. However, block distributions with larger block sizes and uniform or increasing weights should work well in most situations. "

  propensity score, which is a generalization of discriminant matching,
  (ii) multivariate adjustment by subclassification on the propensity
  score where the same subclasses are used to estimate treatment effects
  for all outcome variables and in all subpopulations, and (iii) visual

abstract = "Meta-analysis plays an important role in summarizing and synthesizing scientific evidence derived from multiple studies. With high-dimensional data, the incorporation of variable selection into meta-analysis improves model interpretation and prediction. Existing variable selection methods require direct access to raw data, which may not be available in practical situations. We propose a new approach, sparse meta-analysis (SMA), in which variable selection for meta-analysis is based solely on summary statistics and the effect sizes of each covariate are allowed to vary among studies. We show that the SMA enjoys the oracle property if the estimated covariance matrix of the parameter estimators from each study is available. We also show that our approach achieves selection consistency and estimation consistency even when summary statistics include only the variance estimators or no variance/covariance information at all. Simulation studies and applications to high-throughput genomics studies demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.",

 abstract = {A new method is presented for flexible regression modeling of high dimensional data. The model takes the form of an expansion in product spline basis functions, where the number of basis functions as well as the parameters associated with each one (product degree and knot locations) are automatically determined by the data. This procedure is motivated by the recursive partitioning approach to regression and shares its attractive properties. Unlike recursive partitioning, however, this method produces continuous models with continuous derivatives. It has more power and flexibility to model relationships that are nearly additive or involve interactions in at most a few variables. In addition, the model can be represented in a form that separately identifies the additive contributions and those associated with the different multivariable interactions.},
